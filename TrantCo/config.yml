          As the Senior Lead in the Store Print and Create IT team, I have been a driving force behind numerous innovative projects for Officeworks' store environments. 
          I was responsible for designing and developing standardised operating environments (SOEs), integrating software systems, automating processes, and commissioning hardware. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in defining business requirements for contract negotiations.
          One of my recent achievements out side of my normal duties was successfully leading the complete redesign and implementation of in-store testing environments across two sites during the Officeworks Support office relocation.

          Highlights
          - Upgraded payment systems, integrating new PINpads (Ingenico Lane 3000 and Quest QT850) and Quest as a payment provider.
          - Implemented eight printer types from four vendors, enhancing printing capabilities.
          - Facilitated seamless communication with API integration between internal and external partners.
          - Led project planning, requirements gathering, and post-deployment support.
          - Designed scalable architecture and standardised operating environments (SOE).
          - Ensured PCI compliance management within store environments.
          - Developed training materials and documentation for effective knowledge transfer.
